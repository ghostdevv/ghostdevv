## Hi there! I am GHOST ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full Stack Web Developer (primarily), working from the UK. I contribute to many projects, you can checkout some of my newest projects in the pinned repos below.

### My favourite quotes:

"Weâ€™re all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?"<br />
"Do you know what thinking is? Itâ€™s just a fancy word for changing your mind."<br />
"In 900 years of time and space, Iâ€™ve never met anyone who wasnâ€™t important"<br />
"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift... that is why it's called the present"<br />
"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"<br />
"Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection"<br />
"The secret of getting ahead is getting started"<br />

  Didn't want to include this outside of a comment, but for those reading I think you might enjoy this quote:
  
  "with enough random bobble heads running around trying to commit sacrilege on your codebase it quickly becomes a problem of control to maintain the quality"
