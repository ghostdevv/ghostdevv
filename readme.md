## Hi there! I am GHOST ðŸ‘‹
I am a Full Stack Web Developer (primarily), working from the UK. I contribute to projects like [Routify](https://github.com/roxiness/routify) and [Dashargs](https://github.com/ghoststools/dashargs).

### My favourite quotes:

"Weâ€™re all stories, in the end. Just make it a good one, eh?"<br />
"Do you know what thinking is? Itâ€™s just a fancy word for changing your mind."<br />
"In 900 years of time and space, Iâ€™ve never met anyone who wasnâ€™t important"<br />
"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift... that is why it's called the present"<br />
"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away"<br />
"Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection"<br />
"The secret of getting ahead is getting started"<br />
